# AGENTS.md — Tiberian Sun reverse engineering project

Guidance for agents working in this repository.

## What this project is

A full disassembly of **Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun** (Westwood Studios,
1999, retail PC release) back into compilable C++ source.

The goal is **complete, documented, change-ready source** — not a partial
sketch. "It compiles" is not the bar; "every class is present, every claim is
traceable to binary evidence, and a human can confidently edit it" is the bar.

## Ground rules

1. **Evidence or it doesn't go in.** Every declaration must cite its source:
   RTTI descriptor VA, vtable VA, constructor VA, INI key string, or function
   VA. Never invent a member, name, or type.
2. **Mark uncertainty explicitly.** Use `/* ? */` for anything inferred but not
   proven. Use `vfunc_N` for virtuals whose semantics aren't established.
   Honest gaps are worth more than confident guesses.
3. **Verify against the binary, not against the previous agent's output.**
   Re-resolve vtable→class bindings through the COL chain. Re-read the bytes.
4. **Keep the build green.** `build/tu_all.cpp` must compile after every change.
5. **Regenerate, don't hand-patch, generated files.** If a header is produced by
   a tool in `tools/`, fix the tool and re-run it. Anything you want to keep must
   live in `src/handwritten/`; the pipeline wipes `src/include/` and restores
   the hand-written set, which always wins over a generated header.
6. **The pipeline must be reproducible from a clean checkout.** Run
   `./tools/pipeline.sh` against an empty `out/` and `src/include/` before
   claiming a change works. A stage that depends on an artifact no tool
   produces is a bug.

## Toolchain

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools/rtti.py` | MSVC 6 RTTI recovery → classes, vtables, COLs |
| `tools/demangle.py` | MSVC mangled-name demangler |
| `tools/disasm.py` | function boundary + call-graph recovery |
| `tools/gen_strings.py` | referenced-string / INI-key extraction |
| `tools/gen_manifest.py` | per-class vtable/ctor manifest |
| `tools/reduce_bases.py` | transitive → direct base reduction |
| `tools/gen_members.py` | data-member offset recovery from ctors |
| `tools/name_members.py` | member naming from INI-key store sites |
| `tools/gen_signatures.py` | calling convention / arity recovery |
| `tools/gen_headers.py` | header emission from the manifest |
| `tools/reconcile_prelude.py` | prelude/header base reconciliation |
| `tools/make_selfcontained.py` | add missing includes per header |
| `tools/verify.py` | full verification gate |

Run order is encoded in `tools/pipeline.sh` (10 stages). Do not run stages by
hand out of order; `out/` artifacts feed forward.

## Build / verify

The gate is `tools/verify.py`, which checks standalone compilation of every
header, a combined translation unit, class coverage against the manifest, and
vtable→class bindings:

```bash
cd re
./tools/pipeline.sh            # regenerate everything, then verify
python3 tools/verify.py src/include build/shim
```

A change is not done until `VERIFICATION PASSED` is printed.

Every header must also compile standalone:

```bash
for h in src/include/*.h; do
  g++ -std=c++03 -fsyntax-only -Isrc/include -Ibuild/shim -include "$h" -x c++ /dev/null || echo "FAIL $h"
done
```

## Key technical facts

- Target is PE32 i386, MSVC 6.0, ImageBase `0x400000`, `.text` at `0x401000`.
- RTTI is intact. `type_info` layout: `+0x00` vftable, `+0x04` spare,
  `+0x08` inline mangled name. The `type_info` vftable is at `0x6a7d04`.
- Complete Object Locator layout in this binary: `+0x00` signature, `+0x04`
  offset, `+0x08` reserved, `+0x0c` pTypeDescriptor, `+0x10` pClassDescriptor.
  The COL pointer sits immediately **before** the vtable.
- RTTI base-class arrays list **transitive** bases. `out/direct_bases.json`
  holds the reduced direct-base set; use that for C++ inheritance.
- INI key strings are the original struct member names. `out/ini_keys.json`.

## Subagent notes

- Background/async subagents require `@earendil-works/chord`. It is not part of
  the default install; `1.1.0` is installed under
  `pi-coding-agent/node_modules/@earendil-works/chord`. If async children fail
  with a chord error, run the workflow with `async: false`.
- Give reconstruction agents **tight, bounded scopes** and tell them explicitly
  not to write giant inline heredocs — one agent previously burned its entire
  budget that way and produced nothing.
- Parallel writers must target **disjoint file sets**.

## Current status

Last updated at commit `722f807` (P1 closed out, pushed to `origin/main`).

**Done and verified.** RTTI recovery (788 type descriptors, 755 hierarchies,
843 vtables), disassembly (9,057 functions), full class manifest (749 classes,
9,810 virtual slots, every class has a located constructor), direct-base
reduction, member offsets (4,634 across 629 classes), member names from INI
keys (135 across 20 classes), virtual names (1,242 across 624 classes),
signatures (8,689 functions with calling conventions), and headers for all 749
classes. The pipeline reproduces all of it from `bin/GAME.EXE` alone and
`tools/verify.py` passes: 690/690 standalone, combined TU PASS, 749/749
coverage, 200/200 vtable bindings.

**P2, verified but not yet integrated.** Three hand-written template headers
were added under `src/handwritten/` after recovering the layouts from the
binary and corroborating them across instantiations:

- `VectorClass.h` — `VectorClass<T>`, `DynamicVectorClass<T>`, `TypeList<T>`.
  Layout confirmed from ctor `0x445640` and dtor `0x445570` (offsets +4 data,
  +8 count, +0xc active, +0xd allocated gating the free; +0x10 capacity,
  +0x14 growth step default 10). Covers 309 manifest instantiations.
- `Blitter.h` — the `Blit*`/`RLEBlit*` family, 110 instantiations across 97
  template names, with the `<E>`/`<G>` pixel-format split proven from operand
  width (stride 1 vs 2).
- `Pipe.h` — the 20-class Pipe/Straw IO hierarchy with all 80 virtuals named
  from call-site evidence (LCW, LZO, PKZIP, Blowfish, SHA-1, base64).

**In progress (currently RED).** Teaching `tools/gen_headers.py` to skip
manifest entries that are instantiations of these hand-written templates, and
to spell bases from the authoritative RTTI name instead of un-mangling the
ident. Suppression works (536 entries skipped); the remaining failure is
template arguments that have no header and are not yet declared. Standalone
compilation is currently 145/257 and the combined TU fails. Do not push until
`tools/verify.py` passes again.
